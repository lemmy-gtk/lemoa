# Troubleshooting

### Flatpak installation doesn't follow the system Gtk theme

In order to apply a different theme when using Flatpak, run

```
flatpak override --filesystem=/usr/share/themes/
flatpak override --env GTK_THEME=Adwaita-dark
```

You can replace `Adwaita-dark` with the name of any other Gtk theme you have installed.

If you don't use Flatpak, the correct Gtk Theme should be applied automatically.

# Build dependencies

- rust
- cargo
- pkg-config
- libgtk-4-dev or gtk4-devel (name depends on the distro)

# Building

## Building with meson

```
meson --prefix="/usr" _build
ninja -C _build
sudo ninja -C _build install
```

## Building with Docker

```
sudo docker build --no-cache . -t lemoa:latest
CONTAINER_ID=$(sudo docker create --name lemoa -t lemoa:latest)
sudo docker cp $(CONTAINER_ID):/root/lemoa/target/release/lemoa .
```

Once the build is done, there will be an executable `lemoa` binary file in your current directory, executing it starts Lemoa :tada:.

## Building the binary only

Not recommended: To only install the binary (can only be started with the terminal), run

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/lemmygtk/lemoa.git
```


You can then start the app via the terminal after adding cargo's bin directory to your PATH variable.

# Development

Clone the repository and run

```sh
cargo run
```
