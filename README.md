# Build dependencies

- rust
- cargo
- libgtk-4-dev

# Installation

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/lemmy-gtk/lemoa.git
```

You can then start the app via the terminal after adding cargo's bin directory to your PATH variable

```sh
lemoa
```

# Development

Clone the repository and run

```sh
cargo run
```

# Building with Docker

```
sudo docker build --no-cache . -t lemoa:latest
CONTAINER_ID=$(sudo docker create --name lemoa -t lemoa:latest)
sudo docker cp $(CONTAINER_ID):/root/lemoa/target/release/lemoa .
```

Once the build is done, there will be an executable `lemoa` binary file in your current directory, executing it starts Lemoa :tada:.

# Building with meson
```
meson _build
ninja -C _build
sudo ninja -C _build install
```
